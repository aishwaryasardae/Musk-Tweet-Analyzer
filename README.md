__NLTK-Based Text Analysis Toolkit:__

The NLTK-Based Text Analysis Toolkit project aims to develop a comprehensive Python package for text analysis tasks using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This toolkit will provide a suite of functionalities for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of textual data. By leveraging NLTK's capabilities, the package will empower users to perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The primary objective is to streamline the text analysis workflow and facilitate insights extraction from unstructured textual data, making it valuable for various data science applications.

__Proposed Design:__
Implementing the NLP model entails the creation of modules for text data processing and machine learning modeling, focusing on tasks like classification and sentiment analysis. These modules will be designed to preprocess textual data, ensuring it is cleaned, normalized, and vectorized for analysis.

The main module of the library will be the preprocessor, encompassing a class dedicated to preprocessing tasks. This class will house methods for normalization, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and other essential text processing techniques. By integrating these functionalities into a unified preprocessor class, users can efficiently preprocess textual data with ease.

Additionally, the library will include a machine learning model fitting and evaluation module. This module will feature classes for different machine learning models, such as Naïve Bayes and N-gram models, along with methods for model fitting, transformation, prediction, and evaluation. By providing a variety of machine learning models and evaluation techniques, users can choose the most suitable approach for their specific NLP tasks.

The implementation of the proposed design will depend on several external libraries, including re (regular expressions), TensorFlow, NLTK, NumPy, and Pandas. These libraries will be leveraged to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and customization of the implemented methods. By integrating with established libraries like TensorFlow for deep learning capabilities and NLTK for NLP functionalities, the proposed design aims to provide a comprehensive and versatile NLP toolkit for text data analysis.

__ELON MUSK TWEET ANALYSIS__

The objective of this project is to perform word frequency analysis. This link provides Twitter data of Elon Musk from 2010-2022. For analysis consider the years 2017-2022 (last 6 complete years). Each year has thousands of tweets. Assume each year to be a document (all the tweets in one year will be considered as a document)

1.Compute the term frequencies for each year.
2.They should be normalized (scale of [0, 1]).
3.Exclude stopwords.
4.Show the top 10 words (for each year) by highest value of word frequency.
5.Plot a histogram of word frequencies for each year
6.Demonstrate Zipf’s law by plotting log-log plots of word frequencies v. rank for each year
7.Use TF-IDF to calculate and show the 5 most “important” words for each y
